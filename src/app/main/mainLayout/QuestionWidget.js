                                            VaultFi aims to lead the new era of DeFi 3.0, backed by revenue-generating businesses.
                                            At the heart of VaultFi's strategy is the "Vault" system, a revolutionary solution designed
                                            to sustainably generate high Annual Percentage Yield (APY) for the community.

                                            Recognizing the challenges faced by previous DeFi projects,
                                            VaultFi has developed a clear roadmap that integrates revenue-generating projects with several
                                            diversified sources of yield, aimed at resilience and APY sustainability.

                                            Multi-vault diversification system, positions VaultFi as a pioneering, robust ecosystem in DeFi 3.0.
                                            Furthermore, it is led by a doxxed team with 20+ years of real-life business, marketing, and mergers
                                            &amp; acquisitions experience.

                                            VaultFi introduces various sources of yield beyond the traditional sell tax.
                                            This includes integrating projects from its Web3 incubator, CoinRock Ventures, into its portfolio,
                                            which helps diversify and enhance the returns.

                                            In the initial phase, VaultFi employs a tax revenue system where a percentage of each sell
                                            transaction is funneled into the treasury.
                                            This constant inflow helps support the treasury's capacity to provide yield, regardless of market
                                            conditions.
                                        </p>

                                            The roadmap of VaultFi is structured into phases that gradually build up the ecosystem's robustness.
                                            Each phase introduces more assets and strategies for yield generation, reducing reliance on any
                                            single source and spreading risk.

                                            In later phases, VaultFi plans to further diversify its APY sources by incorporating multiple Vaults
                                            that include a variety of digital assets and projects.
                                            This not only spreads risk but also creates more opportunities for earning returns.

                                            The treasury's active management ensures that funds are allocated efficiently to sustain APY. This
                                            includes investing in profitable ventures and managing assets in a way that balances growth with
                                            yield provision.
