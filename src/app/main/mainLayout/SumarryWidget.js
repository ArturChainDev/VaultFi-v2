                VaultFi: Pioneering DeFi 3.0, with APY backed by revenue-generating businesses.

                At the heart of VaultFi's strategy is the Vault system, a revolutionary solution designed to sustainably generate high Annual Percentage Yield (APY).

                Recognizing the challenges faced by previous DeFi projects, VaultFi has developed a clear roadmap that introduces several diversified sources of yield, aimed at resilience and sustainability.

                The VaultFi roadmap includes integrating revenue-generating projects from CoinRock Ventures, our cutting-edge Web3 incubator and accelerator, as well as acquiring stakes in robust projects, broadening the VaultFi yield-generating APY strategies to include a variety of revenue-generating assets.

                Users will be able to choose from multiple VaultFi Vaults, each offering yields tied to different digital assets, projects and narratives, thus expanding their exposure options.
